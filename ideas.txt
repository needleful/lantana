How should I make a test engine. What features do I want?

Modules:
- Core
	- Update loop
	- File system
	- Module loading
	- Rendering
- State
	- data structures
	- current entities and scenes
	- state serialization
- Simulation
	- Game logic

How to reload each module:
- Simulation
	- Just unload the library, delete the old instance, and reload the DLL
- State
	- Serialize current state
	- Unload simulation and state (simulation depends on state code)
	- Load state
	- Deserialize state (with new variables filled in with defaults and removed variables ignored)
	- Load simulation
- Core
	- Serialize current state
	- Restart application
	- Deserialize state
	- Re-apply state (load resources and other things)


My desired workflow
- Start in an empty field
- Define the level by loading from a GLTF file
- Create entities and add them to a file system
